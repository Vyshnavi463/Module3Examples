Company----> Develop a software for my organisation.    System Based/StandAlone software
Company--->he wants to reach users across geographical locations for his exapnsion of business.
A sofware which can be used throughout the globe for any geographical locations.
A software has to be put some where  so that it can reach and be accessblie to everyone
One-Media----------------->It connects all users throught a globe ----------------> an they are interconnected------> internet
A software has to be put on an internet then only my software would be able to reach to all customers.
Internet---is also know has a "Web"
Application to be deveoped which can work or put on this "Web".
Such software put on the Web ---- we term it has   " Web-Application".

1.Web Application?
An Application Developed by any Software language and which availbale globally to be used  by all users .
Web Applications can developed by Jsdk(J2EE,JEE)...


**************************

2. Types of Web Application


a) Static Web Applications
Tejasvini---Customer: She needs a Webplication to be developed for our organisation ngo...
Requirements:
1. We dont want any data storage.
2. Wwe want to adevrtise and reach the users throuhght the globe where my users can come to know about or organozation.

1.Knowledge   of   (Html)  Added Knowldege---(css,javascript,bootstrap);



b)Dynamic Web Application
 A Collection of Web-Pages ---------WebApplication( Dynamic Programms which can interact with one another    )----->hosted on the web-----website
Tejasvini---Customer: She needs a Webplication to be developed for our organisation ngo...
Requirements:
1.We want any data storage
2. We want customers to fille they menersbhio details on web only

How to develop Dynamic WebApplications?
1. Servlets    (KNOW,LEARN,IMPLEMENT)
2.JSP (KNOW,LEARN,IMPLEMENT)


c)Enterpise Web Applications
1. Servlets    (KNOW,LEARN,IMPLEMENT)
2.JSP (KNOW,LEARN,IMPLEMENT)
3.EJB,RMI,RMIIOP,JNDI,ORB

   

Web-Application Working?

1. A web application is a collection of programmes written in Java using Servlets and Jsp

JVM+JRE
2.An these programmes require a software to execute these progrmmes  " Web-Server"

		JVM+JRE+WEBSERVER


3.WebApplication has to be put inside the Webserver to be used by users across the globle to access it

	WebApplication<---------  deploy-------------->WebServer

1. First thing  is to buy the domain from the isp provider,buy the space,if ur using db---buy...

2.WebApplication----(Servlet,Jsp,Html)

3.Install the Webserver

4.Start writing the code using servlet,jspp..

5.This code we should put it inside the webserver in a particular directory structure and check the working of individual programms

6. WebServer ----- serves the request.

7.  Then who takes care of execution and check weatger the programme is right or not?

	Ans: Web Container,Container,ServletContainer-------------> this is the area wher the lifecyle of ur programms are managed
		An these Programmes   are know has ---> Component/ Web Componet


		Web-Server---->Webcontainer
WebComponent ------->WebContainer



8. To Test them we require a client software:

Ans: Browser

9. To make request to ur web componnet which are plcaed inside the webserver and executed by the componenet we require a client software ie browser

10: From a browser to make a request to these components which are inside the webserver we nee to use a protocol "http"
Why http?
Because our webservers are desighned in such a way that they only recognize the request made by using http protocol
client               -----------------http--request---------> webserver(     (webservrer memory) Container(componentt));                                
	<-------------response-- http-----------------------

		http was chosen has the mainstream protocol because over the web the request would for different type of data
		(text,coluful,images,audio,video)
